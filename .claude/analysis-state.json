      "description": "The NABPS seal logo on the homepage is wrapped in multiple nested divs including a blur effect, white background padding, and a cyan ring (ring-4 ring-cyan/30). This creates a 'ring around the ring logo' that makes the actual seal smaller and less clear, reducing brand recognition and visual impact.",
      "location": "src/components/features/hero.tsx:28-44",
      "impact": "Primary brand identifier is diminished. Users cannot clearly see the NABPS seal which contains important branding elements (CMYK colors, association name). This violates Nielsen's Aesthetic & Minimalist Design heuristic by adding unnecessary decorative elements that obscure meaning.",
      "remediation": "Remove all wrapper divs and decorative effects. Display the SVG logo directly at full size (minimum 160x160px on desktop, 120x120px mobile). Use the transparent SVG provided by the user (nabps_seal_transparent.svg) without any rings, glows, or backgrounds. Let the logo's inherent design (outer circle, CMYK blocks, text) provide visual interest.",

      "description": "The website uses off-white (#F8F9FA) as the primary background color (globals.css line 9) and gray-50 to white gradients throughout (hero.tsx line 8). This creates a washed-out appearance that lacks the professional gravitas needed for an election standards organization. Reference sites like seachangemn.com and runbeck.net use dark navy foundations that convey trust and authority.",

      "remediation": "Implement a modern Navy gradient hero section:\n- Hero background: Navy 900 (#102A43) to Navy 800 (#1E3A5F) gradient\n- Add subtle teal accent overlays (teal-500 at 5% opacity)\n- Use white/off-white for content sections to provide contrast\n- Ensure text maintains WCAG AAA contrast (white text on Navy)\n- Reference: SeaChange uses #2E2C33 dark foundation with #13D0CA teal accents",
